        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="p1">
            <p> <b style="font-size: 2rem;">S</b>trawberries are sweet supple red fruits with surfaces that are
                seed-<br>
                studded. They come from low-growing plant belonging to genus<br>
                Fragaria of the rose (Rosaceae) family, enclosing white flowers, lobed<br>foliage, and runners. They
                originate all through the north temperates zones.</p>
            <p>They are the most famous and trendiest fruits in the planet (Roger). There<br>
                are over 600 assortments of strawberries that vary in taste, size, and feel;<br>
                all of which have similar trait; heart silhouette, red fleshy tissue with yellow<br>
                seeds shooting the surfaces, petite, royal, leafy green lids, and stalk<br>
                that embellish their crown (WHFoods). Below is picture of the strawberry fruit</p>

        <h2>Detailed History</h2>
        <p>The word strawberry is coined from "strewn" berries about the plants and<br>
            thus the "strewn berry" finally turned into "Strawberry" (Roger). They are<br>
            not actual fruits or berries but distended ends of the stamen of the plant.<br>
            The seeds are on the external surface, rather than the internal berry. There<br>
            are around 200 seed for each berry. They are low in calories and are<br>
            non-fat, loaded with vitamin c, folic acid, fiber, vitamin B6 and potassium<br>
            (Roger)</p>
        <p>Over the years they have been utilized as medications for ailments like,<br>
            stained teeth, sunburns, gouts and digestion (Hopley, 9). Strawberries<br>
            were served up at medieval state occasions as a show of peace, wealth,<br>
            and excellence. The most well-known communal intake of strawberries is<br>
            at Wimbledon anually, when strawberries and cream are eaten by very<br>
            well attired Englishmen in the middle of tennis games (Hopley, 9)</p>
